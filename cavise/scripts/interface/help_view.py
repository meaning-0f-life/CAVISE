            Shows running simulations, docker/docker compose versions, hardware statuses

        Admin Panel -> Simulator control panel:

            - Select File: Choose a Docker Compose configuration file.
            - Custom Parameters: Specify additional Docker Compose options (optional).
            - Select Services: Specify which services to start, stop, or restart (optional).
            - Build Button: Builds the Docker services.

            - Down Button: Stops and removes the Docker containers.
            - Restart Button: Restarts the Docker services.

            1. Select File (File Selector)
                Purpose: Choose a Docker Compose configuration file.
                Where to Write: In this field, enter the name of the configuration file you want to use. If no file is selected, the form will automatically use the first file in the list.
            2. Custom Parameters (Custom Params Input)
                Purpose: Specify any additional parameters that will be passed to Docker Compose commands.
                Where to Write: Enter custom flags or options for the Docker Compose command. These can include options like --build, --pull, --quiet, etc.
                You can view the full list of parameters by following here: https://gabrieldemarmiesse.github.io/python-on-whales/
            3. Select Services (Services Input)

            Buttons for Docker Compose Actions

            These buttons are the primary actions you will use in this form. Each button will execute a corresponding Docker Compose command with the parameters you specify.
            4. Build (Build Button)
                Purpose: This button will run the docker compose build command to build your Docker services based on the selected file and parameters.
            5. Up (Up Button)
                Purpose: This button will run the docker compose up command, which starts the Docker services.
            6. Down (Down Button)
                Purpose: This button will run the docker compose down command to stop the services and remove the associated containers.
            7. Restart (Restart Button)
                Purpose: This button will run the docker compose restart command to restart services without shutting down the entire environment.

            Output Area (Script Output)

                Purpose: Displays the logs and status of the actions you perform.
                What to Expect: After clicking any button (e.g., Build, Up, Down, Restart), the output will appear here. It shows real-time logs, errors, or success messages from Docker Compose.

        Admin Panel -> ComponentName Info:

            Shows hardware resources used by the container and his logs in real-time mode

        Generate Compose Configs:

            CAVISE docker-compose generator. This tool is used to dynamically
                create docker-compose configs depending on one's needs. Originally,
                the needs were:
                    - use local builds or pull containers from remotes
                    - optional artery mount
                these might be extended further.

            Usage:

                --help                  prints this message.
                --version               prints script version.
                -v, --verbosity         set logger verbosity, numbers are related to python
                                        logging levels, for ex. 10 - Debug, 20 - INFO.
                -e, --env-file FILE     name or absolute path to .env file that is used in preprocessing.
                -t, --template FILE     name or absolute path to template file.
                --handlers HANDLERS...  list of handlers to use. Overrides --pack, if also supplied.
                --pack PACK             pre-defined list of handlers to use.
                --output-name NAME      name of output file, defaults to compose.yml
                --output-path PATH      path, where output file is stored. Defaults to simdata.
                --template-path PATH    path, where template files are looked up.
                --environment-path PATH path, where .env files are looked up.

        Scenario Manager:

            This panel is designed for sending API requests and displaying the responses. It consists of several key components:
